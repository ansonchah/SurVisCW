        "abstract": "This study aims to assess passive design features through the extensive modifications of building envelopes to affect the energy efficiency of residential buildings in hot arid climates. In support of the aim of this research, the annual electric energy bill of a typical residential building in Sharurah was collected and analyzed. Then, the DesignBuilder simulation program was used to investigate how different modifications of building envelopes could affect the energy consumption of the residential buildings under common scenarios. Varied thermal insulation, different types of glass, shading devices, and green roof were investigated with this perspective. The simulation results show that thermal insulation can significantly reduce annual energy consumption by as high as 23.6%, followed by green roofs. In contrast, shading devices and glazing system types were fewer superiors. The results also indicate that the effective combination of certain strategies can reduce total energy consumption by 35.4% relative to the base case (BC) of this research.",

        "abstract": "Energy efficiency, which is a key factor of sustainable building design is very beneficial to building occupants. This has made the focus on sustainability in the design, to be highly desirable. Studies show that two third of the energy used in existing residential buildings in Nigeria is generated via electricity, however; due to epileptic power supply, high cost of energy and high carbon emission, there is a need to minimize energy demand in the facility. This research evaluated sustainable design strategies and their effects on energy efficiency in warm humid climate of Nigeria. The climate, building envelope, heating, ventilation and air conditioning and lighting systems constitute are the main factors responsible for energy intake of a building. The research was based on case study of Covenant University Health Centre and data was collected through visual survey. The case study revealed that the building, at the time of construction did not consider sustainable design strategies in terms of materials of the building envelope, wall and window shading as well as natural means of cooling. Only lighting was considered.",

        "abstract": "The main objective of the Nigerian building sector working on achieving energy efficiency is to decrease energy demand of buildings and thereby reduce the negative implications of urban development and poor energy infrastructure on people's wellbeing. One of the key strategies being adopted for substantial reduction of energy demand in the Building Energy Efficiency Guide for Nigeria is the bioclimatic architectural design approach. Hence, intelligent design of buildings, especially the building envelope, can considerably improve energy efficiency and help to realize heating and cooling targets. The aim of this paper is to promote and encourage sustainable building development in Nigeria by developing a systematic and context-based framework for the design of energy efficient residential buildings. This study adopted a mixed method approach of interviews with 12 architects and 22 householders. Moreover, measurements and observational surveys of 22 existing buildings that fit into three distinct building typologies were conducted. Three existing buildings were investigated using a building simulation approach to compare their performances, especially in terms of thermal comfort. The data collected was analysed using content analysis, descriptive statistics analysis, and simulations. The interviews with architects and householders showed enormous potential to reduce residential buildings\u2019 energy demand. To achieve this, the interviewees emphasized the need for strong collaboration between all stakeholders in the building sector. Measurements, observational surveys, and case studies of existing buildings confirmed that thermal discomfort in residential buildings and challenges with building design, have a significant effect on the building occupants\u2019 wellbeing. The research developed a framework for the design of energy-efficient residential building, which is expected to enhance sustainability, particularly in the building sector. The framework was produced based on the findings from the research data and the review of relevant literature. It involves an integrated process focused on bridging the gap between building stakeholders achieving sustainability in buildings. Ultimately, the framework is hoped to guide professionals in the design of energy-efficient buildings and assist institutions on policy guidelines.",

        "abstract": "Energy consumption is increasing due to the rise in the world population, industrialization, and urbanization, particularly in the residential sector, attributed to a lack of user-friendly tools. This study seeks to create a research framework and wireframe for home energy-saving applications. A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted using the VOSviewer software version 1.6.18 tool to pinpoint the research problems. Three key research problems were identified: Inadequate information presentation for both experts and non-experts, insufficient consideration for middle-aged and elderly users, and difficulties in interpreting graphics or images on the application\u2019s display screens. This qualitative research involved three rounds of co-creation activities with nine experts and nine non-experts to identify major problems and preliminary solutions. As a result, two key issues were addressed from the qualitative data: The problem of area calculation, resolved by simplifying data entry processes, and the issue of material selection within homes, improved by incorporating illustrative images with concise, easily understandable descriptions. The outcome of this research is a framework and wireframe that lays the groundwork for developing user-friendly applications that promote sustainable behaviors in residential energy usage. This research contributes valuable guidelines for developers and stakeholders to create more efficient and user-friendly applications, thus promoting environmental action and sustainable practices in residential settings.",

        "abstract": "In the past decade, Chinese urban areas have seen rapid development, and rural areas are becoming the next construction hotspot. The development of rural buildings in China has lagged behind urban development, and there is a lack of energy-efficient rural buildings. Rural houses in severe cold regions have the characteristics of large energy exchange, a long heating cycle, and low construction costs. Energy consumption is a crucial issue for rural houses in severe cold regions. How to balance the energy efficiency and building cost become a crucial problem. To solve this problem, we investigate the energy consumption of rural housing in cold regions, using Longquan Village in Heilongjiang Province, northeast China, as a case study. A low-energy design framework is established that considers the spatial layout, building type, enclosure system, and heating system. With the support of project funds, a demonstration house is constructed, and the energy savings performance of the building is investigated during the heating period. The results indicate that the energy savings rate of the demonstration house is 66%. The demonstration building enables local residents to learn construction methods for low-energy houses and promotes energy efficiency.",

        "abstract": "The per capita energy usage in Saudi Arabia is almost three times higher than the global average. A major contributor is the residential sector which consumes almost 50% of the total national energy consumption every year. Environmental and economic pressures along with the Saudi Vision 2030 reform program advocate for an improvement in energy consumption patterns. For a sustainable residential sector, energy-efficient solutions should be adopted in the design process preferably based on building performance simulation (BPS). This study investigates the existing status and future prospects of BPS in the construction industry of Saudi Arabia. A survey has been carried out with building industry professionals to investigate the existing practices in terms of use of BPS. Energy and environmental savings achievable through application of BPS have been estimated by modelling a typical residential villa as a case study. The results indicate that presently BPS is not being adequately applied by the building industry and a number of barriers exist which need to be addressed. The case study simulation indicates that electricity consumption of a villa based on a BPS-based design process is 51.3% less than the existing typical residential villa.",
